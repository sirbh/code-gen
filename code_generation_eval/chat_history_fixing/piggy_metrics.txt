================================== Ai Message ==================================

The Docker containers failed to start due to a Prisma schema validation error. The error message indicates that there are missing opposite relation fields in the Prisma schema for the `Statistics` and `NotificationSettings` models. Specifically, the `Account` relation field in these models is missing an opposite relation field on the `Account` model.

Here's a summary of the errors:
1. **Statistics Model**: The relation field `Account` is missing an opposite relation field on the `Account` model.
2. **NotificationSettings Model**: The relation field `Account` is missing an opposite relation field on the `Account` model.

To fix this, you need to update the `schema.prisma` file to include the missing relation fields in the `Account` model. Would you like me to attempt to fix this issue for you?

================================== Ai Message ==================================

It seems there was an error while trying to fix the server code. The error message indicates an issue with parsing the input, possibly due to a formatting issue in the instructions or errors provided.

Let's manually address the issue by updating the `schema.prisma` file. Here's how you can fix it:

1. Open the `schema.prisma` file in your project.
2. Locate the `Account` model and add the missing relation fields for `Statistics` and `NotificationSettings`.
3. Ensure that each relation is properly defined with the correct fields and references.

Here's an example of how you might define these relations:

```prisma
model Account {
  id                  Int                  @id @default(autoincrement())
  statistics          Statistics[]
  notificationSettings NotificationSettings[]
}

model Statistics {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  data      Json
  accountId Int
  Account   Account  @relation(fields: [accountId], references: [id])
}

model NotificationSettings {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  settings  Json
  accountId Int
  Account   Account  @relation(fields: [accountId], references: [id])
}
```

After making these changes, try running the Docker containers again. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The Docker containers failed to start again due to a new Prisma schema validation error. The error message indicates that the relation fields `Statistics` and `NotificationSettings` on the `Account` model should not specify the `fields` or `references` argument in the `@relation` attribute. These should only be specified on the opposite fields in the `Statistics` and `NotificationSettings` models.        

Here's how you can fix it:

1. Open the `schema.prisma` file in your project.
2. Update the `Account` model to remove the `references` argument from the `@relation` attribute for the `Statistics` and `NotificationSettings` fields.

Here's an example of how you might define these relations correctly:

```prisma
model Account {
  id                  Int                  @id @default(autoincrement())
  balance             Float
  statistics          Statistics[]
  notificationSettings NotificationSettings[]
}

model Statistics {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  data      Json
  accountId Int
  Account   Account  @relation(fields: [accountId], references: [id])
}

model NotificationSettings {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  settings  Json
  accountId Int
  Account   Account  @relation(fields: [accountId], references: [id])
}
```
