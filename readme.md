# CRUD Microservice Code Generator

This AI-powered tool automates the creation of CRUD microservices, generating server code in JavaScript. It follows an **API-First development approach**, ensuring that API design serves as the foundation of application development.

---

## **API-First Approach Overview**

The **API-First approach** emphasizes defining your API before writing any code. Key steps include:

1. Creating a detailed API specification using tools like OpenAPI.
2. Using the API spec as a blueprint for development and testing.
3. Aligning all application components and external systems with the APIâ€™s structure and functionality.

This approach is particularly effective for microservices, facilitating clear communication between services and ensuring consistent integration.

## **Setup**

Follow these steps to set up the CRUD Microservice Code Generator:

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Repository**: 
   - Go to the `frontend` folder and run:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

2. **Run the Development Server**: 
   - Start the frontend development server with:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Access the application at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).

3. **Run the Backend Server**: 
   - Navigate to the folder containing `server.py`, then run:
     ```bash
     python server.py
     ```

4. **Ensure Both Servers Are Running**: 
   - The frontend and backend servers must be operational before using the system.

## **Requirements**

Make sure the following are met before proceeding:

- **Docker Installed**: Install Docker to run the generated microservice in a containerized environment.
- **Docker Running**: Ensure Docker is running, as the system relies on it to execute the server locally.

## **How to Use the CRUD Microservice Code Generator**

### **Step 1: Generate the OpenAPI Specification**
1. **Initiate the Process**: Start by prompting the system, e.g., "Generate OpenAPI spec for products microservice."
2. **Review the Spec**: The generated specification will appear on the left-hand side of the interface.
3. **Modify the Spec**: Update the spec as needed to suit your requirements.
4. **Save the Spec**: Command the system to save the spec to a file.  
   **Note**: The system will fail if this step is skipped.
5. **Verify File Creation**: Ensure the file `openapi_spec.yml` is created in your working directory.

---

### **Step 2: Generate the Server Code**
1. **Press the "Generate" Button**: Confirm that `openapi_spec.yml` is saved, then press "Generate" in the interface.
2. **Code Generation**: The system generates all necessary server code in a folder named `express-server`.
3. **Transition to Interaction Screen**: After code generation, you will be redirected to interact with the server.

---

### **Step 3: Interact with the Server**
1. **Run the Server Locally**: Command the system to run the server within a Docker container.
2. **Monitor Logs and Status**: Request logs and check the real-time status of services.
3. **Test the Endpoints**: Send test requests to the endpoints and observe the responses.
4. **Fix Code Issues**: If any issues arise, instruct the system to fix the code. It will make the necessary adjustments to ensure functionality.

## **Goal**

The system streamlines the entire development process, enabling you to:

- Generate an API specification.
- Create server code.
- Test and debug a fully functional microservice.

All tasks are performed interactively with the LLM, ensuring an efficient and seamless development workflow centered around a well-defined API.
