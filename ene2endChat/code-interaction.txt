================================== Ai Message ==================================

It seems there was an error while trying to start the Docker containers. The error message indicates that the port `3000` is already in use on your system. This means another application or service is currently using this port, preventing the Docker container from binding to it. 

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check for Running Services**: Identify if any other service is using port `3000` and stop it. You can use commands like `netstat -ano` on Windows or `lsof -i :3000` on macOS/Linux to find the process using the port.

2. **Change the Port**: Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to use a different port. For example, change the line `- "3000:3000"` to `- "3001:3000"` and try running the containers again.

3. **Stop Conflicting Services**: If you have another instance of the same service running, you might want to stop it before starting the Docker containers.

Would you like to try one of these solutions, or do you need further assistance?
