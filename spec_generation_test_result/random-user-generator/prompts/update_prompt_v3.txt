2. **Revert URL Change:**
   - Change the `url` in the `servers` array back to `https://randomuser.me` from `https://api.randomuser.me/`.

3. **Revert Tag Name Changes:**
   - Change the `name` of the first tag in the `tags` array from `User` back to `Overview`.
   - In the `paths` object, under `/api` and `get`, change the first tag from `User` back to `Endpoints`.

4. **Re-add Removed Tags:**

     - **Tag 4:**
       - **Name:** `Overview > Issues`
       - **Description:** `These are some of the current issues with the Random User API

- The endpoint is just one - /api\*
- The reason we can’t precisely specify the exact location when calling the API is that the data of users are random. So you will always get a random location regardless of the one you specify.  
    (The only way around this is to specify nationality.)`
     - **Tag 5:**
       - **Name:** `Endpoints`
       - **Description:** `Only `GET` requests are allowed now.`
     - **Tag 6:**

       - **Description:** `The Random API returns HTTP status code and error code messages.

| HTTP Code | Message | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

| 400 | Bad Request | The request was invalid or missing a required parameter. |
| 404 | Not Found | The requested resource not found. |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | An error occurred on the server |`
