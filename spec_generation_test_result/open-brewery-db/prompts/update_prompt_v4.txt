To revert the changes in `output_spec.json` and align it with the original specification, follow these detailed instructions:

1. **Restore the Removed Description**:
   - Navigate to the path `root['paths']['/breweries/{id}']['get']` in the `output_spec.json` file.
   - Add the missing `description` field back to this path. Ensure that the description matches exactly what was present in the original specification.

2. **Correct the Example Value for Latitude and Longitude**:
   - Locate the path `root['paths']['/breweries']['get']['parameters'][1]['example']` in the `output_spec.json` file.
   - Update the `example` value from `-117.129593` to `-117.129593,32.714813` to match the original specification.

3. **Verify Example Values for Pagination Parameters**:
   - Check the path `root['paths']['/breweries']['get']['parameters'][4]['example']` in the `output_spec.json` file.
     - Ensure the `example` value is `1`. If it is already `1`, no change is needed.
   - Similarly, verify the path `root['paths']['/breweries']['get']['parameters'][5]['example']`.
     - Ensure the `example` value is `10`. If it is already `10`, no change is needed.

By following these steps, the `output_spec.json` will be reverted to match the original specification accurately.
