The Google Geocoding API provides a service for geocoding and reverse geocoding addresses. Below is a detailed description of the API endpoint based on the provided OpenAPI specification:

### Endpoint Details
- **Endpoint Path**: `/maps/api/geocode/json`
- **HTTP Method**: `GET`
- **Base URL**: `https://maps.googleapis.com`

### Functionality
This endpoint allows users to:
- Convert a street address into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).
- Convert geographic coordinates into a human-readable address.
- Retrieve the address for a given place ID.

### Parameters
- **Header Parameter**:
  - `Accept`: Specifies the media type of the response. Example value: `application/json`.

### Request Body
- This endpoint does not require a request body.

### Response
- **Status Code 200**: Indicates a successful request.
  - **Headers**:
    - `Content-Type`: The media type of the response, which is `application/json`.
  - **Response Body**:
    - **Type**: `object`
    - **Fields**:
      - `results`: An array of objects, each containing:
        - `address_components`: An array of objects detailing parts of the address, such as `long_name`, `short_name`, and `types` (e.g., route, postal town, country).
        - `formatted_address`: A string representing the complete address.
        - `geometry`: An object containing:
          - `bounds`: An object with `northeast` and `southwest` coordinates defining the bounding box.
          - `location`: An object with `lat` and `lng` for the exact location.
          - `location_type`: A string indicating the type of location (e.g., `GEOMETRIC_CENTER`).
          - `viewport`: An object similar to `bounds` for map display purposes.
        - `place_id`: A unique identifier for the place.
        - `types`: An array of strings indicating the type of location (e.g., `route`).
      - `status`: A string indicating the status of the request (e.g., `OK`).

### Additional Information
- The accuracy of geocoded locations may vary by country, and users should refer to the `location_type` field to assess the match quality.
- The availability of geocoding data is subject to change based on Google's contracts with data providers.
