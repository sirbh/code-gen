To revert the changes in `output_spec.json` to match the original `input_spec.json`, follow these steps:

1. **Correct the URL Formatting in the Description of the Third Tag:**
   - Locate the third element in the `tags` array.
   - Find the `description` field within this element.
   - Update the `description` field to include a newline character at the end of the URL. 
     - **Current in `output_spec.json`:**
       ```
       https://randomuser.me/
       ```
     - **Change to:**
       ```
       https://randomuser.me/\n
       ```

2. **Adjust the Description Formatting in the Fifth Tag:**
   - Locate the fifth element in the `tags` array.
   - Find the `description` field within this element.
   - Ensure the asterisk in the endpoint description is escaped properly.
     - **Current in `output_spec.json`:**
       ```
       - The endpoint is just one - /api*
       ```
     - **Change to:**
       ```
       - The endpoint is just one - /api\*
       ```

By making these adjustments, the `output_spec.json` will be reverted to match the original `input_spec.json` accurately.
