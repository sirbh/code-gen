To revert the changes in `output_spec.json` and align it with the original specification, follow these detailed instructions:

1. **Remove Added Items:**
   - **Summary:**
     - Locate the `summary` field under `root['paths']['/accounts/']['post']`.
     - Delete the entire `summary` entry.
   - **Request Body:**
     - Locate the `requestBody` field under `root['paths']['/accounts/']['post']`.
     - Delete the entire `requestBody` entry.

2. **Revert Changed Values:**
   - **Description:**
     - Navigate to `root['paths']['/accounts/']['post']['description']`.
     - Change the value from `"This endpoint allows the creation of a new account."` back to `"Register new account."`.
   - **Responses:**
     - Navigate to `root['paths']['/accounts/']['post']['responses']`.
     - Replace the entire response object with the original:
       ```json
       {
         "200": {
           "description": "Valid request.",
           "content": {
             "application/json": {
               "schema": {}
             }
           }
         },
         "default": {
           "description": "Invalid request."
         }
       }
       ```

By following these steps, `output_spec.json` will be reverted to match the original specification as described in `input_spec.json`. Ensure each change is made precisely to maintain the integrity of the original API specification.
